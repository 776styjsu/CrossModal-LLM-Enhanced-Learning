## Setting up Dependencies

To set up the dependencies for the project, please follow the instructions below:

1. Open your command prompt or terminal.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the command `conda env create -f environment.yml`. This will create a new conda environment with the name specified in the `environment.yml` file, and install all the necessary dependencies.

4. Once the installation is complete, activate the environment by running the command `conda activate <environment-name>`. Replace `<environment-name>` with the name of the environment created in step 3.

5. You're now ready to use the project with all the required dependencies installed.

**Note:** Make sure you have [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installed on your system before following the above steps.
